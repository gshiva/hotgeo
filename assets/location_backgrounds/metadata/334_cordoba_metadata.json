        "origin_story": "Salmorejo is Cordoba's answer to gazpacho, but thicker and richer. Farm workers created it using stale bread, ripe tomatoes, and olive oil - ingredients always available in Andalusia. The bread makes it creamy without dairy. The jamón and egg toppings add protein. Perfect for blazing Cordoban summers when temperatures hit 45°C (113°F).",

        "origin_story": "This hefty Cordoban specialty resembles a large croquette. The name means 'little flamenco' possibly because the spiral inside looks like a flamenco dancer's ruffled dress when sliced. It's protein-packed comfort food, invented when Cordobans wrapped leftover pork around jamón scraps. Now it's a point of local pride.",

        "origin_story": "Cordoba's bullfighting tradition created this dish - using the toro's tail after corridas (bullfights). The meat is tough, requiring hours of slow cooking. The result is intensely flavorful, almost like French boeuf bourguignon. Locals eat it during Feria de Córdoba (May fair week) and at traditional taverns year-round.",

During the 8th-10th centuries when Cordoba was the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate, it was Western Europe's largest, most cultured city. The Moors brought eggplants and honey-drizzling traditions that survive today.",
