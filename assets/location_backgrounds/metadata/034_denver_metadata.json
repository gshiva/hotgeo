  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: Denver is nicknamed the Mile High City because the 13th step on the west side of the Colorado State Capitol Building is exactly 5,280 feet (one mile) above sea level. At this altitude, golf balls fly 10% farther, water boils at lower temperature (affecting cooking), the sky is measurably bluer due to less water vapor, and there's 25% less UV protection - but Denver enjoys 300 days of annual sunshine, more than San Diego or Miami Beach.",

        "name": "Green Chile (Denver-Style)",
        "description": "A gravy-like, orange-hued pork stew made with Pueblo green chiles (hotter and bolder than New Mexico's Hatch chiles), often with tomatoes and tomatillos. Used to smother burritos, fries, and tortilla-wrapped burgers.",
        "origin_story": "Green chile is the single most emblematic dish of Colorado, creating a unique 'Den-Mex' cuisine subgenre. While originating from Mexican chile verde, Denver's version evolved with local Pueblo chiles and became essential when Mexican and New Mexicans migrated in the 1920s for sugar beet field work and settled permanently. By the 1960s, Denver invented the 'Mexican hamburger' - a burger wrapped in tortilla and smothered in green chile.",
        "where_to_find": "Santiago's (local chain with mild, hot, and half-and-half options, punched with jalapeños and pork), La Loma (recipe from 1973 by Grandma Savina Mendoza, vibrant green with thick consistency), La Casita (50-year-old north Denver spot by late senator Paul Sandoval, olive-hued with sweat-inducing spice), Cherry Cricket (spicy Pueblo-style pork green chile, called 'the best burger you'll ever eat' by Chef Aarón Sánchez), Sam's No. 3 (goes through 60 gallons daily, open 90+ years)."

        "origin_story": "In Denver, the smothered breakfast burrito is more than food - it's an obsession that reflects the city's fusion of Mexican-American culture and Colorado's green chile tradition. Found everywhere from food trucks to diners, it represents Denver's hearty, unpretentious food culture shaped by high altitude living and working-class heritage.",

        "name": "Bison Burger",
        "description": "Burger made from native Great Plains bison meat - leaner than beef with sweeter, more complex flavor. Often topped with Colorado green chile, goat cheese, or caramelized onions.",
        "origin_story": "Long before cattle were introduced to America, bison roamed Colorado's open country. Bison plays a prominent role in Colorado's earliest culinary culture and is still served at some of the oldest eating establishments. The meat is considered healthier than beef and represents Colorado's connection to its Western heritage and Great Plains ecology.",
        "where_to_find": "My Brother's Bar (oldest bar in Denver), Denver ChopHouse & Brewery (steakhouse with craft beer), Ted's Montana Grill (founded by Ted Turner, specializing in bison). Found across LoDo and Cherry Creek neighborhoods with creative, juicy preparations."

The Great American Beer Festival (founded 1982 by Charlie Papazian) attracts 65,000+ attendees annually and has grown from 24 breweries in 1982 to the largest ticketed beer festival in the U.S. Breweries serve Colorado classics alongside their brews in casual, communal settings."
