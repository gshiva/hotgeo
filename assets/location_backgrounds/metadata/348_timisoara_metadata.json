In December 1989, it became the first Romanian city to overthrow communism, sparking the revolution that ended Ceaușescu's regime three days later",

        "origin_story": "Romania's ultimate comfort food, traditionally made for Christmas and weddings. The recipe came from Ottoman times but was perfected by Romanian grandmothers who insist on using sauerkraut leaves, not fresh cabbage. Making sarmale is an all-day affair - families gather to roll hundreds at once",

        "origin_story": "Born in Bucharest in the 1800s when an inn ran out of sausage casings and grilled the meat mixture anyway. The name means 'little ones.' Every Romanian claims their region makes them best. The secret is the meat-to-fat ratio and leaving them to rest overnight so spices penetrate. Grilled over charcoal, never gas",
