The city is also home to the Fuggerei - the world's oldest social housing complex still in use (founded 1521), where rent is still less than 1 Euro per year. Residents must be Catholic, demonstrate financial need, and pray three times daily for the souls of the Fugger family. The Fugger banking dynasty was so wealthy during the Renaissance that they financed emperors, popes, and kings, rivaling nation-states.",

It resembles the 'Zirbelnuss' (pine cone) in the city's coat of arms, giving Augsburg the nickname 'Datschiburg.' 'Datschi' comes from dialect word 'detschen' meaning 'pinching' (as plums are pinched into dough). The original Augsburg version uses shortcrust pastry, while other Bavarian regions use yeast dough.",
