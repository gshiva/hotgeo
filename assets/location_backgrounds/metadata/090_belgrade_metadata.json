  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: In Serbia, rakija (fruit brandy) is treated as medicine! When children have fevers, parents rub rakija on their chest to 'pull out high temperatures.' Sore throat? Wrap a cloth soaked in rakija around your neck. The traditional morning ritual in Serbian villages goes: first eat 1-2 teaspoons of slatko (caramelized fruit sugar), then drink coffee, then rakija. As locals humorously explain: 'Germs gather around slatko, coffee blacks them out, then rakija kills them all!' People even buried homemade rakija underground and dug it up for births or marriages. Every Serbian house has rakija—'without that, it's not home. It's cultural.'",

Coffee is drunk on every occasion, and it's basic courtesy to offer coffee to visitors. After finishing, there's a tradition of 'gledanje u šolju' (fortune telling): flip your cup upside down on a saucer, and when you pick it up, the coffee residue patterns supposedly foretell the future. Coffee culture is central to Serbian social life."
