The city was founded in 1857 by King Mindon as Burma's final royal capital, designed according to Buddhist cosmology with the palace at the exact center. The Mandalay Palace design later inspired Shah Jahan when he created the Taj Mahal.",

        "description": "Hearty, herb-based lemongrass and rice noodle soup in rich, savory fish broth, often supplemented with the crunchy pith of banana tree. Topped with crispy fritters, hard-boiled eggs, and lime wedges. The perfect balanced breakfast.",
        "origin_story": "Mohinga is Myanmar's soul in a bowl - the national dish eaten primarily for breakfast but now popular anytime. Street hawkers develop devoted neighborhood followings, each with their own secret blend of spices and fish. Few people make mohinga at home; instead, they patronize their favorite street vendors who roam the streets with portable setups. The dish originated in central Myanmar along the Irrawaddy River where freshwater fish is abundant.",
        "where_to_find": "Countless street vendors throughout Mandalay (especially mornings), roadside stalls near markets, local tea shops. Mandalay's Chinatown has popular hawkers. The market near U Bein Bridge also serves excellent mohinga. Rarely found in tourist restaurants - this is pure street food culture."
