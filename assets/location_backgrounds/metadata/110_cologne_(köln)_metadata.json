Eau de Cologne perfume was created here in 1709 by Italian perfumer Giovanni Maria Farina, who described it as having 'the scent of a spring morning in Italy.'

Plus, Kölsch beer can ONLY be brewed within Cologne's city limits by law - it's the only beer style protected by regional appellation in Germany!",
