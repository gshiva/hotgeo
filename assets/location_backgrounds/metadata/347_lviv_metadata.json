  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: A Lviv native named Yuriy Kulchytsky opened the first coffeehouse in Vienna in 1683 after stealing Turkish coffee supplies during the siege. A century later, when Lviv joined the Austrian Empire, Viennese returned the favor by opening Lviv's first coffee shops. Today, Lviv has the world's only 'coffee mine' where you wear a helmet and 'extract' coffee beans like coal",

        "description": "Ukraine's soul in a bowl - deep crimson beet soup with beef broth, cabbage, potatoes, and a generous dollop of sour cream. Served with pampushky (garlic bread rolls) and sometimes in a hollowed-out bread bowl",
        "origin_story": "Every Ukrainian grandmother insists her borscht recipe is the only authentic one. Some add prune and lemon zest (Trapezna Idey's version), others swear by rosehip broth (36Po), and purists demand only beef and beets. The debate has raged for centuries. What's certain: good borscht takes 3+ hours and can't be rushed",

        "origin_story": "Ukraine's most misunderstood delicacy. Salo sustained Ukrainian peasants through brutal winters - pure fat is calorie-dense and keeps forever when cured. It's a symbol of Ukrainian resilience. Proper salo should be firm but yielding, never rubbery. Eating it with vodka is tradition, not optional",
