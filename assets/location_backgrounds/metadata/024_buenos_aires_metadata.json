  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: Buenos Aires is the birthplace of tango, a dance born in the working-class districts in the late 1800s from a fusion of Candombé (African slaves), Habanera (Cuban), Mazurka (Polish), and Polka (Czech) dances. The Argentine upper classes shunned it until it became wildly popular in Paris after WWI - then suddenly Buenos Aires elite embraced it because it was 'fashionable in Paris.' UNESCO declared tango Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2009.",

        "name": "Asado (Argentine Barbecue)",
        "description": "Argentina's national dish - beef charcoal or wood-grilled on a large parrilla grill, including chorizo, morcilla, mollejas (sweetbreads), riñón (kidney), chinchulín (chitterlings)",
        "origin_story": "Until the mid-1800s, huge herds of wild cattle roamed the pampas (fertile grasslands around Buenos Aires). Gauchos - colorful horsemen folk heroes similar to North American cowboys - developed a passion for asado. They roasted beef close to slow-burning quebracho tree wood on skewered metal 'asador' structures. The wood produced little smoke and gave rich flavor. In the 19th-20th centuries, as Argentina urbanized and the cattle industry flourished, asado became a festive tradition for Independence Day, May Revolution Day, weekends, birthdays, and weddings. It's not just about meat - it's a social gathering where people talk over Malbec wine from the moment the fire is made.",
        "where_to_find": "Aires Criollos - beloved by locals for no-frills atmosphere and perfectly grilled meat (bife de chorizo, entraña) over wood fire. Parrilla Peña near Avenida Córdoba has 'none of the tourist polish but all the authentic flavors' with generous, juicy portions."

Spanish immigrants brought the recipe to Argentina in the 16th century. The decorative folded edge (repulgue) isn't just aesthetic - it identifies the flavor, since they're traditionally ordered by the dozen with mixed flavors.",

        "origin_story": "Introduced by Italian immigrants, it's a variation of Milan's 'Cotoletta alla milanese' (similar to Wiener Schnitzel). The Milanesa Napolitana version is very Argentinian - invented in Buenos Aires in the 1940s at a restaurant called Napoli on Avenida Corrientes. Legend says the chef accidentally created it while trying to save a burnt milanesa by adding cheese, ham, and tomatoes.",

The mate is passed around, each person drinking the water out and passing back to the server to refill.

Argentines drink an estimated 19 million liters of fernet annually (80% of world consumption).
