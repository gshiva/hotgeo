  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: Vermouth was first produced in Spain right here in Barcelona in 1860, making Catalonia the birthplace of Spanish vermouth! An Italian named Perucchi imported the fortified wine, but Barcelona perfected 'la hora del vermut' (vermouth hour)—a beloved Catalan tradition where friends meet at bars for vermouth served 'al grifo' (on tap from small barrels) with a slice of orange, an olive, and lots of conversation. The tradition is so popular that Catalans say 'anar a fer el vermut' (go have a vermouth), which evokes the entire ritual of aperitif time.",

        "origin_story": "This simple preparation dates back centuries and is the foundation of Catalan cuisine. It's eaten as an accompaniment to every meal or as a base for traditional cured meats. Despite its simplicity—just bread, tomato, oil, and salt—it's a matter of intense regional pride and is served everywhere from humble taverns to Michelin-starred restaurants.",

Catalans drink cava with or without food. Brut Nature (extra dry, no added sugar) is preferred by most Catalans. Barcelona's proximity to Sant Sadurní d'Anoia and Vilafranca del Penedès—centers of cava production—means it's easy to get fresh cava casually."
