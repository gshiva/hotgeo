        "origin_story": "This Madeiran specialty uses laurel wood (native to the island) for grilling, giving the meat a unique aromatic flavor. The beef skewers hang from special hooks above the table - a dramatic presentation. Traditionally eaten at festivals and celebrations, now served at every Madeiran restaurant. Locals argue whether to season with just salt or add garlic.",

The meat is chewy, briny, intensely oceanic. Locals eat them as appetizers with Coral beer. Prying them off rocks requires skill - they clamp down when disturbed.",

The garlic butter (manteiga de alho) is generous - bread glistening with it. Locals eat it with espetada, soup, or just by itself. The sweet potato gives subtle sweetness.",

The fish is jet black with huge teeth - nightmare fuel. But the white flesh is delicate, mild, and flaky. Serving it with fried banana is uniquely Madeiran - sweet and savory combination works brilliantly.",

The unique 'estufagem' aging process heats the wine, creating oxidized flavors that allow it to age indefinitely - bottles from the 1800s are still drinkable. Locals drink dry versions as aperitifs, sweet versions as dessert wine. Used in cooking traditional Madeiran dishes."

The aguardente is strong (40%+ alcohol), honey sweetens it, citrus balances. Locals drink it at poncha bars (tabernas) in Funchal's Old Town. Beware - it's deceptively strong."
