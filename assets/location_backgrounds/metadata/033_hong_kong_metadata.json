The drink emerged in the 1940s when locals couldn't afford British hotel afternoon tea, so dai pai dong (street stalls) created an affordable version using evaporated milk and strong tea blends for laborers who needed high caffeine. It became a symbol of Hong Kong identity during the 1997 handover from Britain to China.",
