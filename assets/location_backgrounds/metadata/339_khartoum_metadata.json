        "origin_story": "This ancient Egyptian dish is Sudan's national breakfast. Fava beans simmer overnight in copper pots, becoming creamy and rich. Street vendors in Khartoum sell it from dawn, ladling it into bowls topped with olive oil, tahini, and fresh vegetables. It's protein-rich, filling, and costs pennies. Sudanese eat it daily with kisra (fermented sorghum flatbread).",

        "origin_story": "Kisra is Sudan's staple bread, similar to Ethiopian injera but thinner. The batter ferments for days, creating sourness. It's cooked on a large flat griddle until bubbles form. Sudanese use it to scoop up stews, breaking off pieces with right hand (left hand is never used for eating). The fermentation makes it digestible and nutritious.",

        "origin_story": "Okra grows abundantly in Sudan's Nile River valley. This stew shows African culinary traditions - long slow cooking until okra releases its mucilage, thickening the sauce. Some foreigners dislike okra's texture, but Sudanese embrace it. The stew is eaten with kisra or rice, using fingers to mix and scoop.",

It's served in tiny glasses throughout the day - morning, afternoon, evening, after every meal. Tea ladies (shai ladies) set up sidewalk stands with charcoal braziers.

Locals drink it cold and sweet as refreshment, or hot as digestif. It's served at weddings, celebrations, and daily meals. The tartness is mouth-puckering but addictive."
