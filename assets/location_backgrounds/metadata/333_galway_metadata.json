        "description": "Fresh native oysters from Galway Bay, served raw with lemon, Tabasco, and brown bread - sweet, briny, and creamy",
        "origin_story": "Galway's oyster tradition dates back centuries. The native European oysters (Ostrea edulis) from Galway Bay and Clarenbridge are world-renowned. Oysters take 3 years to grow from seed to plate in the cold Atlantic waters. Moran's Oyster Cottage has been serving Clarenbridge oysters for 250+ years. The annual International Oyster Festival (since 1954) celebrates this heritage with oyster-shucking competitions.",

        "origin_story": "Irish chowder evolved from fishing communities using the day's catch in one pot with potatoes, cream, and butter. Galway's version showcases Atlantic seafood - whatever fishermen brought in that morning. Each pub guards their recipe. The thick, rich chowder warms you after walking Connemara's windswept coast.",

Irish stew is peasant food turned national dish - using affordable lamb cuts, potatoes, onions, and root vegetables slow-cooked until falling apart. It's comfort food for rainy Galway evenings.",

        "how_locals_drink_it": "Galway pubs pour Guinness with the 'two-part pour' - fill 3/4, let it settle, then top it off. Never rush a Guinness. Locals drink it during trad music sessions (traditional Irish music) at historic pubs like Tig Cóilí or The Crane Bar. The perfect pint takes 119.5 seconds to pour. Oysters and Guinness is the classic pairing."

Connemara whiskey is rare Irish peated whiskey. After oysters and Guinness, a whiskey nightcap while listening to fiddles and tin whistles is proper Galway evening ritual."
