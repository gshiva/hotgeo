  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: Rijeka's name means 'river' in Croatian, Italian (Fiume), and Slovene (Reka). This Adriatic port city was so fiercely contested throughout history that it changed rulers between the Holy Roman Empire, Venice, Austria, Italy, and Yugoslavia multiple times. In 1866, the world's first torpedo factory opened here, and in 1912, the RMS Carpathia (famous for rescuing Titanic survivors) was sailing to Rijeka when it received the distress call.",
