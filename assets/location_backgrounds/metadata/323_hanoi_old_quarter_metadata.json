  "name": "Hanoi Old Quarter",
  "country": "Vietnam",
  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: The Nguyen dynasty taxed buildings based on street frontage, leading Hanoians to build 'tube houses' - narrow facades (sometimes just 2-3 meters wide) that stretch deep and high with multiple courtyards, creating the Old Quarter's distinctive narrow architecture that survives 2,000 years later.",

        "description": "Aromatic beef or chicken broth poured over rice noodles, topped with thinly sliced meat, fresh herbs (Thai basil, cilantro, sawtooth coriander), lime, and chili",
        "origin_story": "Born in early 20th century Hanoi, possibly from French pot-au-feu influence during colonial rule. Street vendors balanced bamboo poles with pots of simmering broth, selling bowls at dawn. Hanoi pho is more subtle and refined than southern versions - fewer garnishes, clearer broth, focus on beef. Locals eat it for breakfast, slurping loudly to show appreciation.",
        "where_to_find": "Phở Gia Truyền Bát Đàn (considered best in Hanoi, 50,000 VND per bowl), Pho Thin (unique preparation - beef stir-fried with garlic before adding to soup), Pho Hang Trong (8 Hàng Trống, open 3-8PM), or Phở Sướng at 24B Ngo Trung Yen"

        "origin_story": "Invented in Hanoi's Old Quarter in the 1950s, possibly on Gia Ngu Street near Hang Be Market. The first vendor grilled pork over charcoal, creating smoky patties dunked in sweet-sour-spicy broth. It became Obama and Anthony Bourdain's famous meal in 2016 at Bun Cha Huong Lien - now called the 'Obama bowl.' True Hanoians eat it only at lunch.",

        "origin_story": "French colonizers brought baguettes, Vietnamese added local ingredients. The perfect banh mi has a crispy crust from rice flour-wheat mix, airy inside from high humidity during baking. The filling balance is an art: rich pâté, savory meats, tangy pickles, fresh herbs, spicy chilies. Street carts assemble them to order in 30 seconds.",

        "origin_story": "Invented in 1946 at Giang Cafe when milk was scarce after French departure. Bartender Nguyen Van Giang whipped egg yolks with sugar and condensed milk to create foam topping for coffee. The original cafe still operates, run by his descendants. Drink it hot or iced, but always sip through the foam - never stir.",

        "how_locals_drink_it": "Hanoians gather at plastic tables on sidewalks (bia hoi corners) after work, drinking from small glasses while snacking on peanuts or grilled meats. The beer costs around 5,000-10,000 VND (20-40 cents USD). It's weak (3% alcohol) so locals drink many glasses. Peak time is 4-7PM. The beer is gone when the keg runs out."

        "how_locals_drink_it": "The phin drips coffee slowly - patience is part of the ritual. Sit at a sidewalk cafe watching motorbikes stream past while coffee drips. Stir the condensed milk from bottom, creating a sweet-bitter swirl. Hanoians drink it morning and afternoon. Some prefer hot version (cà phê sữa nóng) in cooler months."
