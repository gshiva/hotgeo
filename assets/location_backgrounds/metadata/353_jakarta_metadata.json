It's been dubbed 'Sukarno's final erection' for its phallic shape, but the design symbolizes lingga and yoni (rice pestle and mortar) representing fertility and eternal life. It houses Indonesia's original independence flag from August 17, 1945, now too threadbare to fly",

        "origin_story": "Born as a way to use leftover rice, nasi goreng became Indonesia's soul food. The key is wok hei (breath of wok) - that smoky char from high-heat frying. Kecap manis gives it the signature sweet-savory-umami flavor. Every street vendor has their own twist, every family recipe is 'most authentic'",

        "origin_story": "Indonesia's street food king. The name comes from Tamil 'satai' meaning grilled meat. The secret is the marinade (turmeric, coriander, lemongrass) and cooking over coconut shell coals for that smoky sweetness. The peanut sauce has 100 variations - some sweet, some spicy, all addictive. You eat it with your hands, not a fork",

Gado-Gado Bon-Bin has been making it since 1960 with the same family recipe - the peanut sauce is the secret, thick and slightly sweet with palm sugar",

CNN named it the world's most delicious food in 2011. The meat should be so tender it falls apart, the sauce should cling like lacquer. It's not curry, it's barely wet",
