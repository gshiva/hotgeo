  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: Pilsen literally revolutionized global beer culture! On October 5, 1842, Bavarian brewmaster Josef Groll brewed the world's first pale lager here, creating golden Pilsner Urquell. Before this, all beer was murky and dark. Pilsen's soft water, Saaz hops, and Moravian barley created a clear, golden beer so extraordinary it shocked even Groll himself. Today, 9 out of 10 beers worldwide are pale lagers based on this Pilsen original!",

        "origin_story": "Created on October 5, 1842, when disgruntled Pilsen citizens dumped barrels of terrible beer in protest and hired Josef Groll to make something better. Using Pilsen's remarkably soft water, local Saaz hops, Moravian barley malt, and Bavarian bottom-fermentation, Groll created the first clear golden lager. The beer was so revolutionary that by 1853 it reached 35 Prague pubs, Vienna by 1856, Paris by 1862. The name 'Pilsner Urquell' (meaning 'original source') was trademarked in 1898.",
