  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: The Lake Palace of Udaipur, seemingly floating on Lake Pichola, inspired the design of the Taj Mahal. When Mughal emperor Shah Jahan rebelled against his father, he hid in Udaipur's Jag Mandir palace - and the palace's impressive architecture later influenced his creation of the Taj Mahal. Udaipur is called the 'Venice of the East' for its interconnected lakes, and was founded in 1553 by Maharana Udai Singh II as the new capital of the Mewar Kingdom.",

        "description": "The holy trinity of Rajasthani cuisine: golden, crispy baatis (wheat dough balls baked in clay ovens), spicy dal (lentil curry), and churma (sweetened crushed wheat with ghee). Smoky, hearty, and utterly indulgent with ghee flowing over everything.",
        "origin_story": "Originated as staple food for Rajput warriors and travelers in ancient Rajputana. The baatis were convenient for long journeys and could be preserved in scorching desert weather. Traditionally prepared in clay ovens or over charcoal, the smoky aroma elevates the whole experience. Warriors needed calorie-dense food that wouldn't spoil - hence the hard-baked baatis and protein-rich dal. The churma (sweet component) provided quick energy.",

        "origin_story": "Traditional Rajput dish originally cooked with wild game (deer, boar) hunted in royal forests. The intense red chili marinade both preserved the meat in desert heat and celebrated the warrior spirit. Rajput warriors prized bold, assertive flavors. Modern versions use mutton but maintain the fierce spice level.",
