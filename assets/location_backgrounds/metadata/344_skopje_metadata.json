  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: In the controversial 'Skopje 2014' project, the government spent $700 million (8-10% of the national budget) to add 284 neoclassical statues and 25 baroque buildings to a city that was rebuilt with brutalist architecture after a 1963 earthquake. The centerpiece is a 22-meter bronze statue called 'Warrior on a Horse' that looks exactly like Alexander the Great but was never officially named that to avoid angering Greece",

Macedonian grandmothers swear by soaking the beans overnight, then slow-baking them with the right paprika blend. Every restaurant claims their version is most authentic, but locals say Debar Maalo street has the best",
