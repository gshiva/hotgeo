        "origin_story": "This cooking method extends back at least 3,000 years to the late Bronze Age. Traditionally, Dalmatian families have special outdoor ovens for peka. The bell-shaped lid (peka) is buried in embers, cooking food with radiant heat and wood smoke - a technique unchanged for millennia.",
