This created a unique Portuguese-Indian fusion culture found nowhere else in the world. The famous vindaloo curry actually originated here from the Portuguese dish 'carne de vinha d'alhos' (meat in wine and garlic), adapted with local spices and vinegar instead of wine.",

        "origin_story": "Evolved from the Portuguese dish 'carne de vinha d'alhos' (meat marinated in wine and garlic). When Portuguese settlers arrived in Goa, wine was replaced with coconut vinegar (toddy), and Indian spices like red chillies (brought from Americas by Portuguese) were added, creating this iconic fusion dish.",
