  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: Nshima, Zambia's national dish, is eaten by hand using the right hand only. Diners shape the thick maize porridge into a ball, make an indentation with their thumb, and use it as an edible scoop for relish. This communal eating method has been practiced for centuries and enhances the social aspect of meals. Zambia has over 72 tribes across 10 provinces, each with unique cooking techniques but unified by the sacred nshima.",

        "origin_story": "Nshima is the cornerstone of Zambian identity, eaten at lunch and dinner by all 72 tribes. Made from finely milled mealie meal mixed with hot water until thick, it's shaped by hand into portions. Ifisashi combines indigenous leafy greens (kalembula sweet potato leaves, chibwabwa pumpkin leaves, or mpilu blackjack leaves) with groundnut paste, creating a rich, nutty vegetarian stew that locals have eaten for generations.",

        "origin_story": "Originating from the Bemba tribe in northeastern Zambia, chikanda is made by drying and grinding wild orchid tubers, then mixing with peanuts and chili. Despite being fully vegetarian, it has a distinctive meaty texture, earning it the nickname 'African Polony.' Foraging the orchid tubers requires traditional knowledge passed down through families.",

The fish are salted and sun-dried on wooden racks, providing crucial protein and income for lakeside communities. This preservation method allows the fish to travel inland to cities like Lusaka, where they're fried crispy and served with nshima.",
