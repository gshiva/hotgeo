  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: Thimphu is the world's only capital city with no traffic lights! Traffic is managed by vigilant policemen wearing white gloves who direct vehicles at major intersections. In 1998, Bhutan removed a trial traffic light simply because people preferred relying on officers—residents felt the impersonal nature of traffic lights didn't suit the communal and human-centric ethos of Bhutanese society. Bhutan also prioritizes Gross National Happiness (GNH) over GDP and is the world's first and only carbon-negative nation!",

        "origin_story": "Often called the 'soul of Bhutanese cuisine,' Ema Datshi represents more than food—it embodies culture, traditions, and agricultural simplicity of Bhutan. What makes it unique is its widespread presence: served at humble family dinners and grand celebratory feasts alike. The cheese (datshi) is made from goat, cow, or yak's milk. This dish showcases the Bhutanese love for extremely spicy food—chilies are treated as a vegetable, not just a seasoning!",

        "how_locals_drink_it": "The most well-known beverage in Bhutan, especially in colder areas. The word suja means 'su' (churned) and 'ja' (chai/tea). Traditionally churned in a wooden device called a dapa for perfect consistency, made using yak butter prized for its high fat content. Unlike sweet teas, Suja is salty, slightly smoky, and deeply nourishing. It's more than a beverage—it's an offering, a social ritual, and a gesture of hospitality. Drunk at special occasions like weddings and Losar (Tibetan New Year). When being hosted, guests are typically served Suja along with Zao (puffed rice roasted with butter and sugar). This tradition dates back to the 7th century."

Ara is a huge part of the country's cultural heritage, stored in traditional flasks. It's drunk during celebrations, festivals, and social gatherings. Stronger than chang (millet beer) because it's distilled."
