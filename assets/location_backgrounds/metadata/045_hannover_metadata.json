  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: Hannover invented the Lüttje Lage drinking ritual - holding both a beer glass and schnapps glass in the same hand and drinking them simultaneously. This tradition dates back to the 16th century beer brewer Cord Broyhan. The trick requires holding the beer between thumb and index finger, schnapps between middle and ring fingers, then raising both to your lips in one go. Master this at Brauhaus Ernst August and you're an honorary Hanoverian!",
