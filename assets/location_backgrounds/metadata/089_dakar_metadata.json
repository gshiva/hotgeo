  "fun_fact": "Fun fact: Senegalese tea culture revolves around 'attaya'—a three-cup ritual that can take up to 3 hours! The word 'ataya' comes from Wolof and means 'the art of making tea.' The tea master boils Chinese green tea with sugar and pours it back and forth between glasses to create foam, serving it three times with each cup progressively sweeter and mintier. The first cup is drunk slightly bitter, the second with more sugar, and the third very sweet. More than 80% of Senegalese people aged 15-60 drink tea, and the ritual promotes conversation and friendship—it's compared to meditation and yoga as a form of practical relaxation!",
